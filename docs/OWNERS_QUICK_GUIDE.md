# Belmont Owner’s Quick Guide

This short guide shows you exactly what to do, in plain English. It takes about 5 minutes to get value on day one.

## What you’ll use today

- Campaign Link Builder (makes special tracking links)
- Review Request Links (easy review invites)
- Google Business Posts (quick posts for your profile)
- Dashboard (see what’s working)

## Three quick wins (today)

1. Create a tracking link

- Open the Campaign Link Builder: [Campaign Link Builder](/apps/utm-dashboard)
- Pick where you’ll share (Google, Instagram, email)
- Copy the link and share it

1. Ask for two reviews

- Open Review Request Links: [Review Request Links](/apps/review-link)
- Copy the message (email or text)
- Send to two recent customers

1. Post one update on Google

- Open Google Business Posts: [Google Business Posts](/apps/gbp-composer)
- Choose a service to feature (men’s cut, beard trim)
- Post it

## What to check on the Dashboard (weekly)

Open [Dashboard](/apps/dashboard)

- Conversions by Source (30 days): shows where bookings come from (Google, Instagram, etc.)
- Conversions by Service (30 days): shows what people book most (men’s cut, beard trim, etc.)
- Contact & Location: phone, address, hours, and quick actions
- Reviews on Google: star rating and total reviews

Tips:

- Double down on what works. If Instagram drives bookings, post there more.
- Feature popular services. If beard trims are up, showcase them in posts.
