# Belmont SEO Lab — Final QA Summary (Ready for Sign‑Off)

Date: 2025-09-08
Audience: Lindsey (Belmont)

## What we checked (plain English)
- We made sure the site builds cleanly with no code errors.
- We opened every tool page to confirm it loads and the right headings show up.
- We spot-checked the visuals so the layout and buttons look consistent.
- We ran an accessibility check so people can use it with a keyboard or screen reader.
- We ran a quick performance test to confirm the pages open quickly.
- We verified SEO basics (titles, sharing previews, sitemap, and robots settings).

## What we saw (results)
- Build and quality checks: Passed.
- Tool pages open and behave: Passed. The dashboard “Load Demo Metrics” button updates numbers immediately.
- Visual consistency: Passed. Screens match the polished UI we shipped.
- Accessibility: Passed at WCAG 2.1 AA level (industry standard). A full summary report is saved for your records.
- Performance: Pages respond quickly on our tests. The dashboard loads smoothly.
- SEO: Sitemap and robots files are in place, and sharing previews are set.

## Ready to launch
- The site is ready for your review and everyday use.
- Nothing blocks launch.

## What to do next (we can do this for you)
1) Turn search indexing on when you’re ready to be visible in Google.
   - Switch `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING` to `true` in your hosting settings.
2) Connect Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to show live conversions on the dashboard.
   - Once connected, the dashboard will show where bookings come from and which services sell best.
3) Optional monthly checkups.
   - We can run a monthly health check and keep an eye on performance and accessibility.

## Sign‑off checklist

## Where reports live (for reference)
- Accessibility report: `tests/accessibility/wcag-summary.json`
- Lighthouse (speed) results: `tests/performance-results.json`
- Visual tests: `test-results/visual/` and `tests/visual/...-snapshots/`

## Security notes
- No secrets are stored in the code. Any API keys live in hosting settings only.
- The app is designed to run safely without keys; features that need keys simply stay disabled until you add them.

If you’d like, we can package this into a one‑page PDF for your records.  
We’re ready for launch whenever you are.
