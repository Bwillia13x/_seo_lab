# WordPress — Add a Seasonal Site Banner (Copy/Paste)

Use this guide to add the promo banner generated by the Offers Orchestrator to a WordPress site in under 2 minutes.

## What you’ll need

- The banner embed code from SEO Lab → Apps → Offers Orchestrator
- WordPress access with permission to edit pages or your header template

## Option A: Add to the Homepage (Block Editor)

1. Open Pages → Home (Edit).
2. Click the "+" button and add a "Custom HTML" block at the very top of the page content.
3. Paste the banner code from SEO Lab into the HTML block.
4. Update/Publish.

Tip: The banner uses "position: sticky; top: 0" so it stays visible at the top as you scroll.

## Option B: Add to the Site Header (Reusable/Global)

1. Appearance → Editor (Site Editor).
2. Open the Header template (or a template part that’s used site‑wide).
3. Add a "Custom HTML" block at the top of the header structure (above the navigation if you want it highest).
4. Paste the banner code.
5. Save changes.

## Remove/Replace the Banner

- To end a promo, delete the HTML block or replace it with a new banner code for the next offer.
- The button link uses the UTM tracking link from SEO Lab, so analytics will show which promo drove bookings.

## Accessibility & Design Notes

- The banner has high contrast (white text on dark background) and a clear call‑to‑action button.
- You can edit the background color (#111) and button color (#22c55e) in the inline styles if you want to match your theme.
- Keep banner text short and specific (e.g., "15% off Skin Fades — Book now").
